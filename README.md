## What is Fair data society?

[Fair data society](https://fairdatasociety.org) is a non-profit initiative to reimagine the data economy and create self-sovereign data commons which protects human rights (e.g. privacy) and enables fair distribution of value.

Fair data society builds on [fair data society principles](https://principles.fairdatasociety.org).
